title: Ruby Conference Australia 2016 - Gold Coast!
---

Ruby Conference Australia was held on the Gold Coast, an area known for spectacular surf beaches, nature and theme parks – also the home of ‘Surfers Paradise’.  Over two days in February, 26 amazing speakers from around the world came to Sea World Resort to share their knowledge through both technical and non-technical talks.  There were five elective workshops that were offered on the first day being Developer Flow, Go, Trailblazer, Rails Girls and Rails Girls Next.  As Vi attended the conference and Sarah attended a workshop separately, this blog post will be split in two parts. The first being a summary of take aways from the various talks of the conference and the second, a description of Rails Girls Next, a workshop that follows from Rails Girls.  Each of section represents our own personal views and experiences.

The Rails Girls Next workshop is a step up from the Rails Girls workshop.

The workshop started at 9am at Sea World Resort. Nothing better than a fantastic location with great morning tea.

#### Why Sinatra instead of Rails?

**Rails**: Things happen magically under the hood.

**Sinatra**: More flexible in comparison, but would require you to implement some elements yourself.

We then began learning the ways of building a Rails app from scratch through Sinatra! Develop your app on the cloud!

#### [Ruby Girls Sinatra App Guide](http://railsgirls-bne.github.io/sinatra-app-guide)

This was written by Sorcha and is a very excellent step-by-step guide we followed to understand how each file works in Rails. It's very easy to follow and quite self-explanatory.

**Caution**: I learnt that Sinatra is NOT structured like how files in Rails would.

For instance, Routing in Sinatra is controlled in the controller, whereas Routing in Rails is in a separate routes file.

#### [Put Your App Online With Heroku](http://railsgirls-bne.github.io/heroku)

I then deployed the app to heroku. A couple of us in the workshop were having a problem with getting the app to deploy (Error: Application not found).

Here's the solution: Since Sinatra is structured slightly differently from Rails, you'll need to modify *config.ru* since gems and classes are located in *config/application.rb*

Big thanks to Sorcha, Rachelle and Daphne for teaching us the tiny details of MVC and Routes.

#### Bonus: Lots of freebies

**Edit**: I had initially wrote my post as "we", based on the idea of us operating as a collective unit. After discussing with Vi, I have changed all the "we/s" to "I". A great point brought up by Vi was on transparency, where we should really be giving a clear picture on what happened. In this case, only I had attended Rails Girls Next, so that's that.

#### Sarah and the conference

At first glance, this probably doesn't make sense.

In short, I actually had to make a quick trip up to Sydney (fun fact: it's a 1.5 hour-long flight) to attend an awards ceremony. I'm humbled to have been nominated by GradConnection as one of the [Top 100 students in Australia](https://au.gradconnection.com/top100/), 2016.  

## In closing…

Thank you to the team at Rails Girls Summer of Code and Ruby Conference Australia for giving both of us the opportunity to attend Ruby Conf Au 2016.  It was fantastic and a great time was had by all!
