### Day #1 Workshops - Rails Girls Next

*Sarah*:

What you need:

- Github account: [https://github.com/join?source=header-home](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
- Cloud 9: [https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free](https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free)

The Rails Girls Next workshop is a step up from the Rails Girls workshop. 

We started at 9am at Sea World Resort. Nothing better than a fantastic location with great morning tea.

#### Why Sinatra instead of Rails?

**Rails**: Things happen magically under the hood.

**Sinatra**: More flexible in comparison, but would require you to implement some elements yourself.

We then began learning the ways of building a Rails app from scratch through Sinatra! Develop your app on the cloud!

#### [Ruby Girls Sinatra App Guide](http://railsgirls-bne.github.io/sinatra-app-guide)

This was written by Sorcha and is a very excellent step-by-step guide we followed to understand how each file works in Rails.

**Caution**: We learnt that Sinatra is NOT structured like how files in Rails would. 

For instance, Routing in Sinatra is controlled in the controller, whereas Routing in Rails is in a separate routes file.

#### [Put Your App Online With Heroku](http://railsgirls-bne.github.io/heroku)

We then deployed our app to heroku. A couple of us were having a problem with getting the app to deploy (Error: Application not found).

Here's the solution: Since Sinatra is structured slightly differently from Rails, we need to modify *config.ru* since gems and classes are located in *config/application.rb*

Big thanks to Sorcha, Rachelle and Daphne for teaching us the tiny details of MVC and Routes!
