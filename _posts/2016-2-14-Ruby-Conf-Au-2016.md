It's us again! Thanks to the generosity of the RGSoC Committee, we were chosen, from the second conference raffle draw, to attend Ruby Conference 2016 in Australia.

This post will be structured with Sarah briefly describing Day #1, and Vi outlining Days #2 and #3 of the conference.

### Day #1 Workshops - Rails Girls Next (Sarah)

What you need:

- Github account: [https://github.com/join?source=header-home](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
- Cloud 9: [https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free](https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free)

The Rails Girls Next workshop is a step up from the Rails Girls workshop. 

The workshop started at 9am at Sea World Resort. Nothing better than a fantastic location with great morning tea.

#### Why Sinatra instead of Rails?

**Rails**: Things happen magically under the hood.

**Sinatra**: More flexible in comparison, but would require you to implement some elements yourself.

We then began learning the ways of building a Rails app from scratch through Sinatra! Develop your app on the cloud!

#### [Ruby Girls Sinatra App Guide](http://railsgirls-bne.github.io/sinatra-app-guide)

This was written by Sorcha and is a very excellent step-by-step guide we followed to understand how each file works in Rails.

**Caution**: I learnt that Sinatra is NOT structured like how files in Rails would. 

For instance, Routing in Sinatra is controlled in the controller, whereas Routing in Rails is in a separate routes file.

#### [Put Your App Online With Heroku](http://railsgirls-bne.github.io/heroku)

I then deployed our app to heroku. A couple of us were having a problem with getting the app to deploy (Error: Application not found).

Here's the solution: Since Sinatra is structured slightly differently from Rails, we need to modify *config.ru* since gems and classes are located in *config/application.rb*

Big thanks to Sorcha, Rachelle and Daphne for teaching us the tiny details of MVC and Routes!
