title: Ruby Conference Australia 2016 - Gold Coast!
---

It's us again! Thanks to the generosity of the RGSoC Committee, we were chosen, from the second conference raffle draw, to attend Ruby Conference 2016 in Australia.

This post will be structured with Sarah briefly describing Day #1, and Vi outlining Days #2 and #3 of the conference.

### Day #1 Workshops - Rails Girls Next (Sarah)

What you need:

- Github account: [https://github.com/join?source=header-home](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
- Cloud 9: [https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free](https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free)

The Rails Girls Next workshop is a step up from the Rails Girls workshop. 

The workshop started at 9am at Sea World Resort. Nothing better than a fantastic location with great morning tea.

#### Why Sinatra instead of Rails?

**Rails**: Things happen magically under the hood.

**Sinatra**: More flexible in comparison, but would require you to implement some elements yourself.

We then began learning the ways of building a Rails app from scratch through Sinatra! Develop your app on the cloud!

#### [Ruby Girls Sinatra App Guide](http://railsgirls-bne.github.io/sinatra-app-guide)

This was written by Sorcha and is a very excellent step-by-step guide we followed to understand how each file works in Rails. It's very easy to follow and quite self-explanatory.

**Caution**: I learnt that Sinatra is NOT structured like how files in Rails would. 

For instance, Routing in Sinatra is controlled in the controller, whereas Routing in Rails is in a separate routes file.

#### [Put Your App Online With Heroku](http://railsgirls-bne.github.io/heroku)

I then deployed the app to heroku. A couple of us in the workshop were having a problem with getting the app to deploy (Error: Application not found).

Here's the solution: Since Sinatra is structured slightly differently from Rails, you'll need to modify *config.ru* since gems and classes are located in *config/application.rb*

Big thanks to Sorcha, Rachelle and Daphne for teaching us the tiny details of MVC and Routes.

#### Bonus: Lots of freebies

**Edit**: I had initially wrote my post as "we", based on the idea of us operating as a collective unit. After discussing with Vi, I have changed all the "we/s" to "I". A great point brought up by Vi was on transparency, where we should really be giving a clear picture on what happened. In this case, only I had attended Rails Girls Next, so that's that.

#### Sarah, where were you on days 2 and 3 of the conference?

At first glance, this probably doesn't make sense. Why miss two whole days of amazing speakers and talks? 

In short, I made a quick trip up to Sydney (fun fact: it's a 1.5 hour-long flight) to attend an awards ceremony. I'm humbled to have been nominated by GradConnection as one of the [Top 100 students in Australia](https://au.gradconnection.com/top100/), 2016.

**(Trust me, it was really tough choosing between RubyConf and the awards ceremony)**

Out of the two awards that I had been nominated for, I walked away with the 'International Student Award'! This also came with a valuable Work Integrated Learning placement in Australia and career coaching! As an international student in Australia, finding work can be tough. As such, it's pretty amazing to have been granted such an opportunity.

Since I only walked away with a taster of Ruby Conf, it's definitely given me greater incentive to attend the next one! Hopefully, next time, I'll be able to stay for the whole thing.
