title: How to Create a Version Number for Your Code - What do the version numbers mean?
---

Recently we released our advertising plugin.  This is an advertising plugin for Discourse and is officially endorsed by the Discourse team.
If you want to install it on your Discourse forum, go here: [https://github.com/team-melbourne-rgsoc2015/discourse-adplugin](https://github.com/team-melbourne-rgsoc2015/discourse-adplugin)

When it was released we did it as a v1.0.0, but how do you know when to change the versions.
Some people do it when they do each commit.  But how 'big' does a commit have to be to change the version number.

Our fantastic coach, Sebastian Glazebrook, put us on a great site called http://semver.org/ which explains when you should change your version number.

Essentially, the below is when you change your version number.  This is extracted = from the above website.

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
