title: How to Test Your Bootstrap HTML stuff when you Don't Have Local Host
---

If you're not on your computer and and what to see how your html elements that use bootstrap look like when you can access local host, you can use this: Bootply.

In [Bootply.com](http://www.bootply.com/) you can copy and [paste your code onto the editor](http://www.bootply.com/new) and then click the "Run" button in the top navigation bar.

Then you can see your items (and how they'd look) and make edits as appropriate.

I used bootply yesterday when I was working on copywriting on a html.erb page.  Unfortunately, I didn't have access to local host (was on a different computer and I was too lazy to figure out (1-2 hours) why local host wasn't working on this particular computer), so because it was only:
* A copywriting activity and,
* A formatting activity
Bootply was enough to work with.

So, in the case that you're doing some formatting with bootstrap and writing, check out bootply.

Note: I'm not associated with them in anyway, I just wrote this post because Bootply helped me to still be productive yesterday!
