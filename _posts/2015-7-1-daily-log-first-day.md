Hi, in this daily log we'll provide updates on the things that we plan to do today and some to-dos for the next day...
We'll also put in our two bob worth on other things, most of it nonsensical probably... but without any further ado here's the daily
log for the first day for Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015 in freezing Melbourne....

Today:

1.  Getting to know our coaching company 
2.  Setting up a text editor in the new computers our lovely coaching company Redbubble.com have loaned us (thanks again guys!)
3.  Getting a local instance of discourse working and being to push from our local instance to our repo
4.  Doing our first daily log :-)
5.  Did our team photo

Weekly goals:
* Setting up the local environment
* Creating a basic plugin
