title: Improving Performance by Using Constants and Variable Correctly
---

This will be a quick post...

In a nutshell, we created an adsense plugin and used constants when we should have used variables.

Variables have to be stored in some kind of memory, whereas constants are set.

The compiler works quickly with constants whereas, it's has to process the variables.

So rule is, use constants where things don't change and use variables when things change.

I know it's obvious... but anyway...
